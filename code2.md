The line if player1_choice == player2_choice itself looks syntactically correct. However, if you're facing an issue, here are a few potential problems:

Variable Initialization: Ensure that player1_choice and player2_choice are defined before this line and actually hold values. If these variables are not initialized or don't contain valid choices (like "rock", "paper", or "scissors"), you'll encounter issues.

Input Format: If you want to check the choices in a case-insensitive manner, you should ensure both choices are lowercase (or uppercase). For example:

python
Copy
if player1_choice.lower() == player2_choice.lower():
Typo or Logical Issue: Make sure you have assigned the correct values to player1_choice and player2_choice earlier in the code. If there's a typo in those variable names or if they are not updated properly before the comparison, the comparison will not work as expected.
